Dear is a project of [Brie Ripley](http://cargocollective.com/brieripley) and [Davis Land](http://davisland.info). Each week, one of us sends an audio letter to the other. Think of it as a radio pen-pal project.

We only have a few rules: each letter must be less than five minutes long (we've already broken that rule), one of us has to post each week, we can't share letters with one another before they are public, and each piece must begin with "Dear, [whoever is the recipient other end]."

We're not quite sure what this thing is yet. We created Dear to force ourselves to do something creative on a semi-regular basis, and now it has started to gain a little following.

We hope our little project comes to mean something to you in some way. If it does, give us a [review on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dear/id1196046884), or maybe [send us a tweet](http://twitter.com/dear_podcast), we'd love to hear from you. :)
